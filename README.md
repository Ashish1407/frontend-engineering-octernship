- Delete button is used on the cards to remove the duplicate elements
- In screen 2, the original string and the resultant string after removing duplicate should be rendered and updated.

 </h3>

# Requirements

- The cards with the same character should have the same background color
- When there is no characters occuring more than one time then a success header will be rendered
  -On Screen 2, clicking on a card delete icon will delete all other appearance of the character in the string.
  The cards shown on the screen should also be updated.
  Let's say if the original string is aabcaccda. Clicking on the first a should leave the string as abcccd.
- When the user goes back to screen 1 then the input field in the scren 1 will remain empty.
